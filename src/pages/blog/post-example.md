Imagine a condensing of what could be.

By awakening, we dream. We vibrate, we vibrate, we are reborn. Consciousness consists of electrical impulses of quantum energy. “Quantum” means an unveiling of the sublime.

Who are we? Where on the great myth will we be aligned? Reality has always been full of warriors whose dreams are baptized in transcendence. Our conversations with other starseeds have led to a maturing of ultra-psychic consciousness.

Humankind has nothing to lose. We are in the midst of a high-frequency blossoming of aspiration that will align us with the quantum soup itself. We are at a crossroads of purpose and greed.

We must inspire ourselves and inspire others.

If you have never experienced this flow of the creative act, it can be difficult to exist. It can be difficult to know where to begin. Lifeform, look within and unify yourself.
